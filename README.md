# Darknet-NG-13-Badge

* This years badge is built around an Open Source Badge Case Built Around the Heltec WiFi LoRa 32(V3) with SMA antenna and IPEX connector with Meshtastic.

* This is the First Released Iteration of the Darknet-NG badge for DEFCON 32

* This year we wanted a smaller footprint, that we could hook onto our backpacks and EDC bags to use year round.

* This case is meant to be customized per Darknet Agent leading up to DEF CON.

* All the parts screw together with 2 M2 by 25 MM screws
